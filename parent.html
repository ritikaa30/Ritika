            South Indian cuisine includes the cuisines of the five southern states of India—Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana—and the union territories of Lakshadweep, and Pondicherry. 
            There are typically vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for all five states. 
            Additionally, all regions have typical main dishes, snacks, light meals, desserts, and drinks that are well known in their respective region.
